# A Review: Emergence of a Stern Layer from the Incorporation of Hydration Interaction into the Gouy-Chapman Model of the Electrical Double Layer

This repository provides an in-depth review of the paper *"Emergence of a Stern Layer from the Incorporation of Hydration Interaction into the Gouy-Chapman Model of the Electrical Double Layer"* by Brown et al.

## Overview
The work explores modifications to the classical Gouy-Chapman model by integrating hydration interactions, leading to the formation of the Stern layer in electrical double layers (EDLs). Key highlights include:

- **Physical Model**: Detailed explanation of the underlying physical assumptions and modifications to the Gouy-Chapman framework.
- **Analytical Insights**: Discussion on the impact of hydration interactions on potential profiles and ion distributions.
- **Applications**: Relevance to electrochemistry, colloidal science, and surface charge phenomena.

## Repository Content
This repository includes:
- A comprehensive review document summarizing the key findings and implications of the paper.
- References for further reading.

## Intended Audience
This project is intended for researchers and enthusiasts in **electrochemistry**, **condensed matter physics**, and **surface science**.
